The overview of the Hadoop framework, tracing its origins back to Google's foundational papers on distributed file systems and parallel processing. The core of Hadoop consists of HDFS for data storage and MapReduce for data processing, though it has evolved into a larger ecosystem through community contributions. Key components explained include Hive and Pig for simplified data querying, Scoop and Flume for data ingestion, and HBase as a dedicated NoSQL database. Hadoop is a loosely coupled system, meaning individual modules can be added or removed without breaking the entire framework. This modularity allows for high levels of integration with both big data and traditional technologies like RDBMS. Ultimately, the text serves as a functional guide to the nine essential pillars required for modern data engineering roles.
