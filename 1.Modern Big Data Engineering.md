This Big Data engineering provides a comprehensive technical roadmap for mastering data ecosystems.Specifically focusing on Hadoop and Spark. The material defines Big Data through the challenges of volume, velocity, and variety.Offering distributed storage and processing as the primary solutions. Key components of the Hadoop ecosystem are detailed.Including HDFS for storage, MapReduce for batch processing, and auxiliary tools like Hive, Scoop, and Flume. 
The guide transitions into modern frameworks, highlighting Spark as a faster alternative capable of both batch and stream processing through its resilient distributed dataset (RDD) architecture.
